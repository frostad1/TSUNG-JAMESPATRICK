1.	Differentiate between Multiprocessing and Multithreading. Explain.
    Multiprocessing increase the computing speed of the system by adding more number of processor or CPUs. Multithreading increase the responsiveness of the system by allowing a process to create more multiple threads of a single process.

2.	Explain the difference between Serial Computing and Parallel Computing.
    Serial computing is a non-parallel which means performs a single task. Only one instruction acted by the processor and only one single data is being used. Parallel computing performs a multiple task at a time in other words multiple execution or cores is being used to solve larger or more complex problems rather than serial processing. Parallel computing saves more time.
